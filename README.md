# Gold Gun game
As a part of the international team, I was involved in mobile game development. The unusual concept of the game, targeting blind or visually impaired customers impressed me the most. The game Gold Gun is a story-driven audio game with no visuals. The main idea is to use modern technologies and a pair of headphones to create a believable 3D audio scene. The development team already had a story script and a game engine. My main task was to develop ingame control system and core gameplay mechanics. The original story script looked more like an audiobook and didn't include any gameplay. I developed a chain of challenging ingame events and interactions. Some series of events formed replayable "minigames" and puzzles.
After testing the first prototypes inside the development team, we started a closed beta test. I took responsibility and developed the testing strategy and organized several beta test sessions.
In January 2019 the GoldGun came out on iOS and Android. In the first 72 hours, the game was downloaded more than 1000 times.
